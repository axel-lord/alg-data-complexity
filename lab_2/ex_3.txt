Choose the best algorithm (among Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick  Sort) to use in the following cases and explain your decision:
The input array is sorted in descending order:
  Mergesort since this is the worst case for both quicksort and insertionsort
The input array is sorted in ascending order:
  Insertionsort since this is it's best case giving it 
  better time complexity than both merge and quicksort
All elements in the array are the same:
  Mergesort since depending on what kind of comparison 
  was used (<= or <) the other algorithms are more
  unpredicatble in their time
There are both positive and negative numbers in the array:
  Quicksort since nothing is really known about the array
  and I don't think the sign matters. With quicksort 
  having a good average case it might be preferable on 
  an array we don't know anything about
